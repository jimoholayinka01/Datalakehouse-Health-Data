### 🛠️ Optimization Commands

```sql
-- Reorganize data for common query patterns
OPTIMIZE health_data.gold.daily_health_summary
ZORDER BY (activity_date, metric_category);

-- Enable automatic optimization
ALTER TABLE health_data.gold.daily_health_summary
SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  'delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true',
  'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact' = 'true'
);
```


## 🏗️ Architecture You'll Build

**Medallion Architecture (Industry Standard):**

## Connecting Databricks to PowerBI
Follow this step-by-step guide to connect Power BI Desktop to your Databricks SQL Warehouse using the native connector. This enables seamless querying of tables in Unity Catalog (e.g., health_data.gold as shown).

#### Step 1: Get Connection Details from Databricks
1. Navigate to **SQL Warehouses** in the Databricks sidebar.
2. Select your warehouse (e.g., Serverless Starter Warehouse).
3. Go to the **Connection details** tab.

You will find:
- **Server hostname** → e.g., dbc-7a... (copy the full hostname)
- **HTTP path** → e.g., /sql/1.0/warehouses/b2... (copy exactly)

<div align="center">
  <img src="visuals/Databricks Connection Credential.png" alt="Databricks Connection Credential" width="80%">
</div>

#### Step 2: Configure the Connection in Power BI Desktop
1. Open **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Click **Get Data** → Search for "**Databricks**" or "**Azure Databricks**".
3. Select the **Databricks** connector (or Azure Databricks if on Azure) → **Connect**.

Fill in the dialog exactly as shown:
- **Server Hostname:** Paste the hostname (e.g., dbc-7a...)
- **HTTP Path:** Paste the full path (e.g., /sql/1.0/warehouses/b2...)

**Advanced options** (recommended for Unity Catalog):
-- **Default catalog:** health_data (or your catalog name)
-- **Database:** gold (your schema containing the gold-layer tables)

Leave other fields as default unless needed.

</div>

4. Click **OK**.
5. Authenticate using **OAuth** (recommended) or a **Personal Access Token** (PAT) if required.
6. In the Navigator, browse your catalog → schema → tables.
7. Select tables (e.g., gold-layer health metrics) and load or use **DirectQuery** for live data.

##### Tips for Success
- Use **DirectQuery** mode for real-time analytics on large Delta Lake tables.
- Ensure your Databricks user has **CAN USE** permissions on the warehouse and **SELECT** on the tables.
- For easier setup, use **Databricks Partner Connect** → Power BI tile to download a pre-configured connection file (available in Premium workspaces).

Once connected, you can build powerful dashboards directly on your lakehouse data!

##### Some DAX Functions
- **Current Body Mass** based on selected Month Filters or the Maximum current date

```
Current Body Mass = 
VAR LatestDate = 
    CALCULATE(
        MAX(daily_health_summary[activity_date]),
        daily_health_summary[metric_name] = "BodyMass"
    )

VAR Result = 
    CALCULATE(
        AVERAGE(daily_health_summary[avg_value]),  // Use AVERAGE in case of multiple rare measurements on the same day
        daily_health_summary[metric_name] = "BodyMass",
        daily_health_summary[activity_date] = LatestDate
    )

RETURN
    Result
```
- **Average Body Temprature**

```
  Avg Body Temp = 
CALCULATE(AVERAGE('daily_health_summary'[avg_value]), 'daily_health_summary'[metric_name] = "BodyTemperature")

```

#### Key Insights And Recommendation

Looking at this 2024 data it shows a consistent active with an average of **~6,280** steps per day and excellent resting heart rate around **48–50 bpm**, which puts you in great cardiovascular shape.
**Strengths:**
- Activity peaks on weekends and Mondays → you're crushing it with weekend hikes or workouts and starting the week strong!
- All metrics in normal range, stable weight, good HRV → strong recovery and low stress on the body.
**Opportunities:**
- Flights climbed average ~15/day – aim for 20+ to boost cardio further.
- Consider adding strength training if calories burned plateau mid-year.
- Keep tracking – your data shows consistency drives results. Set a 2026 goal of 7,000 avg steps and monitor HRV for recovery.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Unity Catalog** → Data governance and discovery
- **Delta Lake** → Reliable storage with ACID transactions
- **Apache Spark** → Distributed processing engine
- **SQL + Python** → Analytics and transformation logic
- **PowerBI** → Enterprise grade analytics with DAX measures
